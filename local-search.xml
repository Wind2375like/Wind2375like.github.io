The script went well on other models except for the T5-large model. I continuously got the CUDA OOM error.</p><p>The T5-large model is not so big and I’m running code on a server with 4 NVIDIA Corporation GP102s. Each one has 12G of video memory. It seems that I could run my code. However, even I set the batch size to 1 for each device, I got the CUDA OOM error.</p><h2 id="Environment">Environment</h2><p>My huggingface transformer version is <code>4.20.1</code> and my code looks like <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/summarization.ipynb">this</a> (<code>preprocess_function</code>, <code>dataset.map</code>, <code>trainer</code>).</p><h2 id="Some-tries">Some tries</h2><p>I followed the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/9311">advice</a> and added <code>--fp16</code> and <code>--sharded_ddp</code> but neither of them work.</p><h2 id="Solution">Solution</h2><p><a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5#transformers.T5Model.parallelize">Parallelize</a></p><p><code>( device_map = None )</code></p><p>Parameters</p><ul><li><strong>device_map</strong> (<code>Dict[int, list]</code>, optional, defaults to None) — A dictionary that maps attention modules to devices. Note that the embedding module and LMHead are always automatically mapped to the first device (for esoteric reasons). That means that the first device should have fewer attention modules mapped to it than other devices. For reference, the t5 models have the following number of attention modules:<ul><li>t5-small: 6</li><li>t5-base: 12</li><li>t5-large: 24</li><li>t5-3b: 24</li><li>t5-11b: 24</li></ul></li></ul><p>Uses a device map to distribute attention modules of the model across several devices.

    <title>Introduction to How Learning Works: 7 Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What is this book about? What is learning? What are the 7 principles of smart teaching? What questions should you ask when learning each principle? How is each chapter organized?</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>I still remember that day when I saw this book: I was busy preparing my final exams and the research project for the next semester, exhausted after came out of the INM study room, and saw this book among other technical books on the public bookshelf. I was attracted to take the book to my home, perhaps because of my curiosity about education and learning. After I have read the abstract on the flap, I am eager to learn more about this book: how to bridge the gap between <strong>science of learning</strong> and <strong>science of instructions</strong> and how to implement the theory to practical use<sup id="fnref:2" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top hint--rounded" aria-label="Oh my fucking god:">[2]</span></a></sup>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-this-book-about">What is this book about?</h2><p>This book is about bridging the <strong>gap</strong> between the <strong>science of learning</strong> and the <strong>science of instruction</strong>. That is, to know how people learn and how to help people learn<sup id="fnref:1" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top hint--rounded" aria-label="There's an HSS course called How People Learn in EPFL for CS master students. It is said to be a good course but with a heavy workload so I didn't choose that course:(">[1]</span></a></sup>.</p><p>One interesting thing is that all of the principles in the book are based on <strong>research-based</strong> theory. What’s more interesting is that these are empirical research with evidence, so the principles are also <strong>evidence based</strong>. That’s where the word <em>science</em> is emphasized.</p><p>How could we bridge the gap? In this book we should focus on:</p><ol><li>The <strong>theory</strong> behind each principle</li><li><strong>Generation</strong> and <strong>refinement</strong> of teaching methods based on the theory</li><li><strong>Adaptation</strong> of the methods to different domains/courses.</li></ol><h2 id="What-is-learning">What is learning?</h2><p>The first basic question before diving into the theory of learning is what learning is. In this book, the authors define the concept as the process that causes changes in people’s minds. The changes result from the interpretation and the response to learners’ experience.</p><ol><li>It is a <strong>process</strong>, instead of the result, score, KPI, etc.</li><li>It should cause a <strong>change</strong> in someone’s mind.</li><li>People <strong>learn by themselves</strong>. They learn from their own experience, not something imposed on them.</li></ol><h2 id="Seven-principles-copy-and-paste">Seven principles (copy and paste)</h2><p>The science of learning and teaching is based on these 7 principles:</p><ol><li>Students’ <strong>prior knowledge</strong> can help or hinder learning.</li><li>How students <strong>organize knowledge</strong> influences how they learn and apply what they know.</li><li>Students’ <strong>motivation</strong> determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn.</li><li>To develop mastery, students must acquire <strong>component skills</strong>, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.</li><li><strong>Goal-directed</strong> practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning.</li><li>Students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual <strong>climate</strong> of the course to impact learning.</li><li>To become <strong>self-directed</strong> learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.</li></ol><p>The <strong>generalizability</strong> of these principles makes the book <strong>powerful</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Domain</strong> independence -&gt; all subjects</li><li><strong>Experience</strong> independence -&gt; all educational levels</li><li>Cross <strong>culture</strong> -&gt; all cultures</li></ol><p>Now the question is: what should you know when you are learning these principles?</p><h2 id="What-should-you-ask-when-reading-7-principles">What should you ask when reading 7 principles?</h2><ol><li><strong><em>Research-based</em> theory</strong>: this is the science behind how people learn and how to help people learn.</li><li><strong><em>Evidence-based</em> approach</strong>: knowing the evidence supporting the theory will give us insight into how to design our teaching method.</li><li><strong>The practical implication to teaching</strong>: how do we design, refine, and adapt our teaching method?</li><li><strong>Clear</strong>: do you get the point the authors trying to convey?

    <title>Could you give me a hint? Generating inference graphs for defeasible reasoning</title>

The arrow shows the causal relationship. Given new evidence, the hypothesis may be strengthened <code>P|U -+-&gt; H</code> or weakened <code>P|U- -x-&gt; H</code>. When it is weakened, this kind of reasoning is called defeasible reasoning. We can treat <code>U</code> as “assumptions” and <code>U-</code> as “defeaters”.</p><p>Then the paper adopted an inference graph (left). Added contextualizers (something related to premises) and mediators (deduction step from <code>U</code> to <code>H</code>). Actually, I think it is the dataset WIQA’s contribution (the two works share the same author Niket) instead of the paper. But anyway the paper switched its context from inference graph to influence graph (right), which is directly from WIQA.</p><div class="group-image-container"><div class="group-image-row"><div class="group-image-wrap"><img alt="Fig 3" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wind2375like/I-m_Ghost@main/img/f36f9ba147a9e2566ea2f9705f2e7b4f06bcabc54772063a67ad538feb065a9b.png" width=50% /></div><div class="group-image-wrap"><img alt="Fig 4" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wind2375like/I-m_Ghost@main/img/24ebec2264b5bf120a465ebce58e4fb71b9800c8f8961b36c594459648f31619.png" width=50%/></div></div></div><p>Green arrow: positive effect.

So you find another similar dataset with labels and adjust it to the same format as your intended task/dataset. Then you train your model on this similar dataset and then do the prediction on your target dataset.</p><p>Since the domain in the test set has changed, a good performance in the test set will indicate not only good accuracy but also excellent generalizability.</p><p>The paper aims to generate an influence graph given <code>P</code>, <code>H</code>, and <code>U</code>. It uses seq2seq architecture. The input of encoder is easy, which is:</p><img alt="Fig 5" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wind2375like/I-m_Ghost@main/img/0b16ab260bf0ce6c2a55d66a46a9991ccd11eee92253b84a7d73dcb479432bf8.png" /><p>The output of decoder is the sequential representation of the influential graph.

EPFL 地处瑞士法语区洛桑, 风景如画, 好山好水好风光, 随手一拍就是个壁纸.</p><p>我的专业 MSCS, 120 ECTS (学分), 1 ECTS 代表一周两个小时的<strong>理论</strong>工作量 (可能是教授拍脑袋想的). 这 120 ECTS 里面包括 72 学分的 core 课和 option 课 (core 至少需要 30 学分), 12 学分的 semester project, 6 学分的人文课 (分上下两学期, 一学期 3 学分), 30 学分的 master thesis, 以及 0 学分的<strong>强制</strong>实习 (自己找或者学校平台会挂一些岗位, 基本都是欧洲的). 选课有一定自由度, 你可以选最多 15 学分的方案外课程甚至本科生课程当作 option 课. 其他专业的选课自由度好像也很高, 比如你甚至可以把 EE 上成 CS (<span class="heimu" title="=.=">万物皆可转码</span>). 这边课程强度我和身边的人认为一学期 30 学分已经很极限了, 会很累, 所以两年基本是读不下来的… 这边平均 2.5 年读完 (四学期课, 一学期毕设), 上限是 8 学期, 这里的时间不包括实习所花的时间, 大部分人还有整学期实习, 所以一般三年读完.</p><img alt="图 1" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wind2375like/I-m_Ghost@main/img/6390279235e5785c4ab5bff114e0cf8dc2ebcda67393a03d6573985fb719a381.png" width="50%" class="center"/><p>具体的 study plan 在<a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/en/master/computer-science/">这里</a>. 每门课会告诉你授课语言 (全都是英文), 在哪一学期开 (1 代表秋季, 2 代表夏季), LEP 代表 lecture, exercise 和 project. exam 分为 oral, written, 和 during the semester.</p><img alt="图 2" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wind2375like/I-m_Ghost@main/img/3ee1b5312aa8383f74548996be252d6d27dd9280dd22896916f43da5c216fdfa.png" /><p>什么是 specialization?</p><blockquote><p>A specialization is a set of courses that allows students to deepen their knowledge of a particular aspect of their main discipline. Thus, it provides  them with the opportunity to develop expertise in a particular area of their master’s degree.</p><p>Computer science and Communication systems students can choose either a specialization or a minor.</p></blockquote><p>这里的 minor 指的是辅修, 辅修规则我不太了解.</p><p>然后洛桑学联有调查过今年的<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Be_tGu9OdUyFEcW1sXHNlQ">录取情况</a>, 不过填的人不是很多, 因为今年不知道为什么发的特别晚, 导致很多拿到 offer 但是没有去的人没有填信息, 甚至去了的人也没有… (比如 XJTU 去了 4 个 ms, 其实还有两个 phd, 还有拿了 offer 没去的)</p><p>还可以去 <a href="https://luocun.org/"><code>luocun.org</code></a> 进一步了解关于洛桑的各种信息.</p><p>经过一个学期, 我感觉在 CS DS CSE EE 这些想科研的人还是很少很少, 绝大部分都是找工了. 其实我是想走科研的路的, 一个学期之后这种感觉愈发强烈, 但是这里还是有点和我想象的不一样.</p><h2 id="天真的想象">天真的想象</h2><p>当初我在 ETHz, EPFL, UCSD, 和 PSU 四所学校之间痛苦选择. 为了有更多时间准备科研和没那么卷去掉了 UCSD, 然后为了更好的平台去掉了 PSU, 为了更感兴趣的教授选了 EPFL. 当时是这么盘算的 (重要性递减):</p><ul><li>research-based master 科研氛围浓</li><li>Antoine 组好厉害</li><li>资源没那么卷</li><li>多上点课补点基础, 本科啥也不会</li><li>安全且便宜</li><li>而且强制实习可以让我体验一下工业界, 感受不同的道路, 算是加分项</li></ul><p>当时我也有一些风险考虑:</p><ul><li>课程压力太大不好做科研</li><li>人好像并不少, CS 有一二百人呢</li><li>因为人有点多, 所以可能会卷, 资源不一定足</li></ul><p>到现在我发现和我想象的不太一样. 这里的人大部分心思并不在科研, 只想找工. 课程的 workload 被我低估了 (算了一下一学期也就三门课, 应该能抽出时间科研吧), 而且课程对科研的实际作用似乎挺有限的. 我高估了自己的能力, 一学期在 seminar 里基本是跟不上别人, 语言表达也是问题, 直接展现了自己最烂的一面. 我也没有考虑到其他专业也在竞争的 pool 内. 光 CS 就快 200, 还有 DS, CSE, EE, 而且他们真的好强, 上了一学期课发现自己原来就是个 five.</p><p>安全是挺安全的, 甚至比国内安全. 但是便宜… 还是算了. 这边物价是全欧洲最贵 (比英国还贵), 税还高. 一年 15w 的开销似乎打不住, 我这几个月都花了 2000+ CHF, 这还是在每个晚上都在挨饿的情况下 (我食量很大quq)… 如果想省钱就只能住 flatshare (但是房子是随机分的, 你也不知道你有什么房子, 有就不错了), 自己做饭 (后面真的没时间, 外面一顿饭 10+), 不旅游不滑雪只学习 (来这里就知道滑雪有多贵了), 那来欧洲的意义是什么… 然后基本要读三年啊, 也不便宜…</p><p><span class="heimu" title="=.=">总是会想, 如果去 PSU 就好了, 但是没有&quot;如果&quot;. 来这里一定是某种缘分.</span></p><h2 id="这课上得还挺值">这课上得还挺值</h2><p>EPFL 的选课具有一定<strong>自由度</strong>, 允许学科交叉, 像 CS 很多课会在 EE 里出现, 而且方案外也可以选 15 学分的课, 身边有人选本科生的算法, sweng, 而我这学期选了 phd 的 NLP seminar, 之后还打算用这 15 分的 quota 选数学系的 causal thinking.</p><p>EPFL 这边的课讲得不能算惊艳, 老师们上课是都有各种口音, 讲得也不是很有意思, 很多也不易于理解. 但是至少上课讲的<strong>核心部分是尽量让所有人能听懂的</strong>, 听不懂 ppt 上的注释或者讲义材料也能让我课后慢慢看懂, 不至于像我本科的时候讲得啥也听不懂, 期末从头找其他材料自学. 而且这些课都是&quot;免费&quot;的 (学费一学期 780 CHF, 不跟白送一样), 对比 cam 的高价学费, 一节课几千人民币岂不美哉.</p><p>这边的课程<strong>广度和深度</strong>跟本科的垃圾相比完全不在一个层面. 其实本科的培养方案还能看, 但是讲的东西就是又少 (EPFL 本科生课的工作量赶上 XJTU 的 2-4 倍了), 又不结合实际应用 (CS 相关的课的代码量几乎为零, 就算有也不会变, 找去年学长学姐要就行, 只顾刷题好考研), 又和现在的方向脱钩 (EPFL 会结合最新的东西来讲, 而且从算法的层面让所有人搞懂), 所以我在本科大概是浪费了三年的时间. 这学期我选的课既有 heavy math (CS-433 ML), 也有 interesting algos (CS-401 Ada, CS-423 DIS), 还有 heavy coding exercises (all), 还有 phd 课程 (CS-612). 在这里上了一学期课感觉各方面能力提升了不少.</p><p>但是一学期的 workload 真的痛苦, 大部分时间都用在课程上了, 导致很难抽出时间自学/做科研, 这学期还是挺被动的. 我才选了 25 学分, 有的人选 30 学分, 真的痛苦面具. 对了, 学分和工作量并不完全对等, 比如有的 4 学分课想学好可能不是一周 8h 的工作量, 而有的 8 学分课可能很水.</p><p>还有一点是就算课程与时俱进, 但是课程还是比较偏离目前科研的最新方向的 (可能 NLP 发展太快了吧). 感觉一学期过去了, 我更加脱离学术圈的发展, 更落伍了. 当然没有基础也看不明白论文, 还是要花点时间从零积累的, 只不过这个度要平衡好吧.</p><h2 id="老师与学生">老师与学生</h2><p>EPFL 的老师不算勤快, 和剑桥 “student is the king” 相比还是逊色很多, 但是至少讲课这块会认真准备, 每年都会更新 (比如 Bob 的 Ada 课在 ppt 的注释会写自己往年讲课的时间管理情况), 并且不会在自己不懂的情况讲课. 这种敬业精神大部分 XJTU 自动化的老师并没有.</p><p>问题是像 CS 系严重扩招, 选课又自由, 导致课程容量太大 (ML, Ada 全都是 400 人大课), 学生很难能和老师互动 (通常是通过助教, 论坛, etc. 获得帮助).</p><p>这边的 semester project 也是一样, 学生太多了, 老师没空带, 一般都是 phd 带, 可能连老师都见不着几面, 所以建立 connection 并不容易.</p><p>大概的确是我太菜了.</p><h2 id="研究型硕士">研究型硕士?</h2><p>当初我以为瑞士的 master 是 research-based 的, 然后上了半学期课有一天听两个同学讨论, 说他们认识好几个放着美国 phd 不要来这里读 MS 的, 因为以为这里是 research-based master, 而且平台更高, 结果大呼上当受骗. 我当时直接绷不住了, 纳闷我来这儿是图啥啊…</p><p>EPFL 的 MSCS 一点也不 research-based. 别忘了, 法语区文化 == 工程师文化. 这边非常鼓励/强迫你去工业界. EPFL 是有强制实习的. 还有十一连续数天的 career fair, 一整个学期的 career service 一步步指导… EPFL 给了条更容易获得欧洲工签的路, 让不少人其实是为了这些来的. 所以很难找到讨论科研的人… semester project 更多是个 project 给 phd 打下手, 写网页做 demo, 老师基本不认识你, 如果想做 research 可能需要一点决心吧.</p><p>但是这里确实有 research 的机会, 还是看自己吧. 虽然 seminar 上得自闭, 但是能读 paper 开始有自己的想法了, 而且稍微不至于在 NLP 的浪潮中掉队太多. 虽然我一个 1st year master 并没有展现出任何能力, 但是也设法抱到了另一个组大佬的大腿, 并且学了些东西. 怎么说呢, 也得到了一些东西, 至少比在 XJTU 好太多了.</p><h2 id="语言">语言</h2><p>语言是我的主要 emo 来源. 我的英语有很大的障碍, 至今仍然听不懂别人在说什么, 也说不明白. 而且法语区街边的东西都是法语, 大家说的话大部分也都是法语, 我也很难练习, 相比之下在英国这一点就很好. 400 人的大课, 我只想去认识和我熟悉的人, 就变成和中国人一起了, 自然也练不了语言. 而且我本身挺自闭的, 不喜欢花大量时间去 social, 只要没有强制的 social, 我就更愿意把时间投到科研, 导致我的语言没法锻炼…</p><p>其实应该是我的性格问题吧. 要么硬着头皮让自己变得 social 起来, 要么保持自我但是需要花更多时间刻意练习, 都做不到那语言就永远不会进步.</p><h2 id="卷不过啊">卷不过啊</h2><p>感觉反倒其他国家的人真的超级努力, 肝, 而且很强, 我自惭形秽. 不好卷.</p><p>不过读到 master, 还卷吗? 有必要吗? 真的只有这一条路吗? 走到这儿了, 明明有很多路的.</p><hr><h2 id="结语">结语</h2><p>EPFL 读下来很累, 每天都要上课写作业. 这里的科研和我想象的有差距, 目前并不算顺利. 这里的生活很无聊, 馆子少, 没啥可逛的, 也没什么游山玩水的时间和钱. 但是, 这里真正让我有了学到东西的成就感, 让我找到了科研和生活的动力. 还有美丽的湖景, 蓝白相间的山, 和快乐的火锅局, 饺子局, 让我觉得这边的生活其实也还不错~</p><hr><img alt="图 6" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wind2375like/I-m_Ghost@main/img/47bc94816560f1ba90b7cb274fb6a36ab73b6a5154bcbd83c5bbb824cd9d0420.png" /><p>景色可以治愈人心~</p><img alt="图 7" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wind2375like/I-m_Ghost@main/img/00c8bfd01d2c535c6331d160b81f3d0c68962cf4ff39db4695423c926ae8b091.png" /><p>火锅爽吃~</p><img alt="图 8" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Wind2375like/I-m_Ghost@main/img/4f676dabfa74cf61e62a5104e8a4e0ec3af13ed3f8397ace5db4351303340769.png" /><p>快乐饺子局~</p>]]></content>

GRE 纯靠背单词和刷机经. 单词机经我用的张巍 GRE 的机经和单词. 主要成败在于 Verbal, Verbal 的成败又在与填空. (阅读很难看懂, 大不了蒙). 最终在裸考 Q 和 AW 的情况下 (考前一天背单词, 看作文), 以 155+167+3.0 在大三用四周结束 GRE.</p><p>托福难度反而比 GRE 大. 阅读在 GRE 训练后单词都不是问题了, 降维打击, 但是听力口语写作还是挺麻烦的. 需要点时间积累… 建议早考出来, 便能早早留出时间做后面的事情. 也能享受到出国交换的机会. 但托福有效期短, 还不能考太早, 算好时间 (大二秋冬考, 申请时就能用上). 献上我的<a href="https://github.com/Wind2375like/My-TOEFL-Experience-Chinese-Version-/blob/main/README.md">愚见</a>.</p><h3 id="科研">科研</h3><p>早做科研可以确定自己适不适合, 同时校内科研经历也是暑研的敲门砖.</p><div style="display:none">如果已经完整被别人带了几次, 差不多发了一两篇 paper, 知道大概生活节奏了, 应该就能确定. 如果始终没找到带飞的人, 全靠自己怎么也做不出, 那还不一定不适合 (比如我)...</div><p>最好科研和申请专业相关度较大, 比如我大二开展第一段科研, 大三冬天第二段, 大三暑假第三段, 都和 NLP 有关, 显然是可以试着申请 MSCS 的.</p><div style="display:none">要学会硬凑, 嗯靠, 把自己的研究说成这个方向... 比如我第一段科研就是个伪代码编译器, 通过对话弹出 exception 交给用户修正, 就美其名曰对话系统了.</div><p>在大多数 CS 的申请学校中, <strong>有分量的 paper</strong> 是很重要的 (没有 connection, 没有牛推, 只能发 paper 了), 厉害的学校可能有厉害的老师和实验室可以进, 但是一般的情况还是抱紧大佬的大腿 (博士生/硕士生 &gt; 学长 &gt; 同级 &gt; 学弟), <strong>请一定要跟能发论文的学生做</strong>, 第一次科研最好能被带飞一次, 熟悉流程, 后面逐渐独立起来, 再靠自己.</p><div style="display:none">在 XJTU 没啥老师能带飞, 就是找有没有肯带发论文的博士生/硕士生. 很少有本科生... 这一届天花板大哥 (Bunsen) 发了一堆给导师带飞了, 还建了个 LUD Lab, 是个特例, 后悔没早去... 整个 XJTU 做 NLP 发顶会的也就天地网和网安了大概, 都是学生...</div><div style="display:none">我很后悔第一次科研其实有两个选择, 一个是跟数据结构的老师做对话系统, 另一个是跟一个博士生学长在一个研究组做对话系统. 我一下子就被数据结构的老师画的大饼给吸引住了, 当时还停留在教授绝对学术能力很强的错觉上, 结果最后发现做一个 template-based, 一堆 if 条件的 parser, 和 ML 没有一点关系, 整整耽误了一年...</div><div style="display:none">我一直期待至少在碰到困难的时候导师/学长能给我重要推进, 帮我解决难关. 可惜我三次科研一次也没有完整体验... 我觉得这是能否坚持下去最重要的东西.</div><div style="display:none">再就是能否让我以良好的心态科研, 没有的话完全没法做, 我会对科研彻底失去兴趣, 甚至有更严重的后果.</div><div style="display:none"> 再就是导师/学长愿不愿意积极跟进我, 解决我的问题 (意味着要花他们的时间), 而不是只能我约他们而不是他们找我. 这个没有也能接受, 但是会很累很累, 很耗时.</div><div style="display:none">最后我小小地希望能在一个平和的环境和心境下科研, 可以很累, 但是最好能沉下心做科研, 少一点浮躁的心理. 个人还是觉得能沉住气扎实地做科研, 长期以来会让科研有更大的发展空间. 但这个我就不奢求了😂.</div><h3 id="中介">中介</h3><p>网上都说 DIY, 但我最终还是选择了 GGU, 然后身边的人也选了 GGU, 都是半 DIY. (为了尽量不打广告, 下面黑幕)</p><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">半 DIY 主要就是人家给你名校专业对口的 mentor (master or phd)+一个培训师带你, 给你提供必要指导信息与最后的文书修改. 所有事情 (选校, 网申,文书初稿) 都要自己完成. 主要有如下原因:</span><div style="display:none">说白了就是靠信息不对等赚钱. 40000 rmb, 包含一些 n 年前的套磁邮件, CV, PS 等样稿, 包含培训师 (非 mentor) 回答各种基本问题, 如怎么套暑研, 怎么写邮件, 怎么 presentation, interview 怎么表现, 进度怎么 feedback, 怎么选校等, 包含 mentor 和培训师的心理疏导, 以及最后 mentor+native speaker对文书内容和语言上的修正. 这么一看亏大了, 我也是这么觉得的, 但是没办法啊!</div><div style="display:none">首先说各种样稿和信息, 确实可以上网查, 上一亩三分地查. 但你敢担保信息的准确性吗? 不还是要找个熟悉的人 double check 下? 就算没问题, 干巴巴的教程在使用的过程中又有一堆问题, 总得需要找人问问. 我试过问地里, 信息质量无法保证, 肯定比不上问身边的人或学长学姐. 但是谁让我们学校出国的人少的可怜呢? 大家只想着保研卷 GPA 卷竞赛的, 我不懂的问题问谁呢? 没什么人可以问. 要是清北华五, 有的是人问, 有的是资源, 自然不需要机构, 但我们这种烂学校, 实在没有 connection, 只能花钱买...</div><div style="display:none">这样信息质量还是不如清北华五. 比如说, 我的 mentor 是 pku->欧陆某 mscs 的, 那么 ta 给我指导的信息来源便是来自于 thu & pku, 显然, ta 只能拥有这部分资源的一个子集. 而培训师的信息来源更是 ta 的经验+ ggu 的数据, 是充满噪声的, 所以其实 ggu 也就是给普通学校 (连资源都没有的) 一点不那么优质的资源罢了, 然后再找清北华五宣传宣传广告, 拉拢一部分靠学校资源 DIY 的当 mentor, 就 ok 了.</div><div style="display:none">XJTU 连飞跃手册都是过时的, 唉, 还得看别的学校的飞跃手册...</div><div style="display:none">所以平台太关键了, 想出国就不要来 XJTU 这个平台. (当然另一位 C9 连国都不好润, 更难...)</div><ol><li><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">花钱的服务是稳定的, 而且确实掌握不少信息. 当然也可以麻烦学长学姐或是一亩三分地, 但是他们也很忙, 效率不高. 或是信息需要甄别, 不完全适合自己.</span></li><li><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">身边高中和大学靠谱的同学选的 GGU, 也有选过的学长成功申到很好的学校.</span></li><li><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">GGU 的 mentor 为名校的 CS master/PhD, 专业领域确实很厉害.</span></li><li><span class="heimu" title="你知道的太多了">文书 mentor 润色+native speaker修改, 确实省很多心. (最终也和学长/姐验证了一下文书确实写的可以.)</span></li></ol><p>最终的服务还算满意.</p><div style="display:none">但是结果却很垃圾. 申请上的学校要么靠 GPA, 要么是因为推荐人和学校的 connection. 不是科班, 没 paper, 没实习, 没牛推, 神仙也救不了. 所以说平台很关键, 不要来 XJTU.</div><p>不过关于选择中介, 我只有一点要说… 自己是最靠谱的, 所有环节务必自己掌握, 切勿交给他人. 对中介也不要抱太大期望, 还是要靠自己的. 这样面对中介的时候心态就会好很多, 甚至会 beyond expectation😂. <strong>主动权仍然在自己</strong>.</p><div style="display:none">GGU 只是一般般, 但有的机构更是大坑, 事后看其他同学其他机构对同学申请的帮助一比较, 还不如找世毕盟 (都是同行衬托得好). 在我看来, 如果只有所谓培训老师, 没有名校专业相关培训导师的话. 如果选校只给你几所的话, 申 ECE 和 EE 或许还能应付, CS 基本别想了.</div><h3 id="交换">交换</h3><p>我个人极力推荐交换, <strong>绝对要关注学校的国际交流信息</strong>或者自己找学校官方的交流. 当然<strong>学校的专业档次</strong>和<strong>项目内容</strong> (什么专业内容) 很重要. 交换是很好的补课以及和教授 connection 联系科研, 要推荐信的好机会.</p><p>个人觉得大三后半学期比较合适, 一方面顺理成章的暑研, 一方面本校专业课的 workload 会变少了. (大概吧, 其实交换也得考虑本校的 workload, 不过我真心推荐交换)</p><div style="display:none">比如本专业一大佬也对 NLP 感兴趣, 本来只是 GPA 高的水平, 但是去港大一波交换修了一堆 DS 和 ML 的课, 专业实力大涨. 暑研又直接抱到大腿导师做 NLP, 发了一个 paper, 现在仍然在组里, 科研生活步向正规, 彻底入门. 我在赞叹之余只能后悔为啥没早点考出来托福, 只能在这所烂校继续虚度光阴.</div><div style="display:none">在这种烂校, 想要乌鸦变凤凰, 只能靠校外的资源了...</div><h3 id="暑研">暑研</h3><p>暑研是个很好的要到<strong>推荐信</strong>和发 paper 的机会.</p><div style="display:none">我无法回答怎么做好暑研和科研, 还是找找别的大佬的文章吧.</div><p>我在大三下学期的 3 月份开始套磁套到一位老师, 然后从 4 月一直干到 11 月, 期间保持一两周 feedback 一次, 很幸运地遇到了很好的老师, 拿到了强推.</p><p>不过我是 remote 做的, 我觉得如果可以的话, 一定要<strong>亲自过去</strong>, 效果会很不一样.</p><div style="display:none">暑研也不算成功. 导师大方向一定, 剩下的全靠自己. 我很茫然, 最初有一个 idea, 然后拼接了两个模型的代码得到一个 baseline, 但是后面再不知怎么做, 在专业知识和代码能力上都遇到了瓶颈. 由于这个方向也不是老师的主攻方向, 无博士/硕士指导, 老师的作用也有限, 由于 remote 对我的 expectation 并不大, feedback 完全需要靠我向老师单线联系. 最终我止步于此. 再就是帮人标注了点数据集. 这就是我暑研的全部工作了...</div><div style="display:none">所以我坚定认为硕士一定要重新来过, 把基础先打牢再说, 因此选择去了瑞士上课而不是 PSU 继续跟着老师.</div><h3 id="选校">选校</h3><p><strong>申请策略:</strong> (对<strong>我</strong>而言)</p><ol><li>不考虑小于两年制的项目, 没有能力做充分准备. (或许你能)</li><li>不考虑申请 PhD (NLP), 没顶会 paper.

(彩票+冲刺+主申+保底)</li><li><strong>多申, 多申, 多申!</strong> (指 CS), 在推荐信可承受范围内多申! (大概得申到 20 个左右)</li><li>主申美国 (科研和工作的机会更大), 考虑了加拿大和欧洲. (10 月末套了几个加拿大的研究型 MSCS 发现老师们本身就说不会回信, 我也真没收到回信, 当时感觉还是实力没有强到让老师愿意联系… 而且申的有点多了怕推荐信不够, 就放弃加拿大了.)</li><li>家里没那么多钱, 学费控制在 80 w RMB, 再就是尽量安全一些.
